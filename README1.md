## Overview

Welcome stranger!!!</br>

This is my first ever Python Project as a research assistant in Dr. Andrew Paluch's team in the term Spring 2019-2020. 
In this project, there are 5 simple Python algorithms for different datatype:
+ ISER Comparing
+ MOSCED Comparing
+ Yaws Data Testing Octanol
+ Yaws Data Testing Water Solute
+ Yaws Data Testing Water Solvent

I have also included data in the textfiles for reference. This is a really simple project but it is my first steps towards programming.
